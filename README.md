# 📰 Fake News Detection

## Overview 📚

The Fake News Detection project is a machine learning application designed to classify news articles as either "Fake News" or "Not A Fake News." This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and apply classification algorithms to detect fake news with high accuracy.

## Features ✨

- **Data Preparation**: Combines and preprocesses datasets of fake and true news articles.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes text data by removing unnecessary characters, URLs, HTML tags, and more.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers for news classification.
- **Evaluation**: Provides performance metrics and classification reports for model evaluation.
- **Manual Testing**: Allows users to input news text for real-time classification using the trained models.

## Installation ⚙️

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

## Data 📁
The project uses two datasets:

- **Fake.csv: Contains news articles labeled as fake.
- **True.csv: Contains news articles labeled as true.

The datasets should be placed in the project directory.

## Usage 🚀
- *Load the Data: Load the datasets and assign class labels.
- *Preprocess the Text: Clean and normalize the text data.
- *Train the Models: Train the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using the preprocessed data.
- *Evaluate the Models: Assess the performance of the models using accuracy scores and classification reports.
- *Manual Testing: Test the models with user-provided news text to classify it as fake or not.


## Running the Script 🖥️
To run the script, execute the following command:

python your_script_name.py

Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your Python script file.

## Manual Testing 📝
You will be prompted to enter news text for testing. 
The script will output predictions from both the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
